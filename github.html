                            GitHub is one of the world’s largest community of developers. It’s an intricate platform that fosters collaboration
                             and communication between developers. GitHub has a number of useful features that enable development teams to work 
                             together on the same project and easily create new versions of software without disrupting the current versions, 
                             but it doesn’t stop there.<br>

                            Once new additions to a program are complete, for example, they can easily be incorporated into existing programs.
                             GitHub also makes it extremely simple to work together on strings of code to really dial in and perfect even the 
                             smallest parts of a program. With GitHub, you can collaborate and work on projects with others anywhere in the world.<br>
            
                            Of course, that’s only scratching the surface, because when it comes to the question “What is GitHub?” the answer is 
                            all about what it can do for you. <br>

                            GitHub enables slick and easy collaboration and version control. This allows you to work on code with anyone from anywhere.
                            Additionally, many employers use GitHub. So, if you plan on getting a job, you’ll look really good if you already know your
                            way around GitHub. And don’t forget about the connections, learning, and portfolio aspects. GitHub is a robust learning and
                            collaboration platform. Take time to explore it and see just how much it can expand your programming knowledge.<br>
